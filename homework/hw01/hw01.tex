\begin{itemize}
\item
  To make grading easier, please include the question with
  the answer.
\item
  Show your work and explain your answer.
  If the answer is an integer, I need to know how you
  got it.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Explicitly write out the contents of the following set:
  \[ \{X\in \mathcal{P}(\{1,2,3\}) : 2\in X\}\]

\item Negate the following statement:

  If $x$ is a rational number and $x\neq 0$, then $\tan(x)$
  is not a rational number.

\item Compute how many 7-digit numbers can be made from the digits
  1,2,3,4,5,6,7 if there is no repetition and the odd digits must
  appear in an unbroken sequence.  Examples: 3571264 or 2415376 or 2467315,
  but not 7234615.

\item
  This problem concerns 4-card hands dealt off a standard 52-card deck.
  How many 4-card hands are there for which all 4 cards are of different
  suits or all 4 cards are red?

\end{enumerate}
