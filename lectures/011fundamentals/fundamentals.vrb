\[
|A\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A\cap B|
\]

How many 3-card hands are there for which all 3 cards are red, or all
three cards are face cards?

$A =$ 3-card hands, all red cards\hfill  $B =$ 3-card hands, all face cards

\begin{align*}
  |A| &= \binom{26}{3}\\
  |B| &= \binom{12}{3}\\
  |A\cap B| &= \binom{6}{3}\\
  |A\cup B| &= |A| + |B| - |A\cap B|
  = \binom{26}{3} + \binom{12}{3} - \binom{6}{3}
\end{align*}
